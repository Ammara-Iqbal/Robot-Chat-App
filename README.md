# 💬 Real-Time Chat App (Frontend Only)

A visually engaging and responsive real-time chat interface built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, designed as part of Assignment 5 for a web development internship.

## 🤖 Chatbot Logic

The chatbot responds based on basic keyword detection. Example:
- You: `hello` → Bot: `Hi there! How can I help you today?`
- You: `how are you` → Bot: `I'm just a bot, but I'm functioning as expected!`

Feel free to expand the chatbot's rules in `script.js`.
